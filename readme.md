<h1>About</h1>
Game created through a DIO project, which aims to copy the dinosaur game, which appears when there is no internet connection.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
The game is not very "playable" yet, I intend to customize it in the near future. The base code wasn't my idea, I implemented it during DIO classes.
